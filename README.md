# Subvertise

Subvertise is an open-source response to the [recent 
bill](http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15100620/congress-fcc-isp-web-browsing-privacy-fire-sale) 
repealing FCC privacy controls for the internet. 

If ISPs can sell your browsing data to advertisers, 
what value with that data have if it's full of false-visits? 

## How it works.

Subvertise just runs in the background, randomly visiting a list of 
random (but safe) websites for random amounts of time. 

You can modify the list of websites to add some spice to it.

When ISPs sell your browsing history, they'll be selling a large list
of random websites, with your actual visits mixed in. Advertisers
won't know what you're really visiting, foiling their sinister plans.
